# SR.COMDiscordBot
Discord Bot which responds to custom queries about users/runs on Speedrun.com

I've been using the following for the Discord.NET calls:
- Discord.NET API version 3.10
- Windows 10 64-bit
- C# within .NET 7.0 Framework

Creation of my Discord bot which utilises both the Discord.NET API and the Speedrun.com C# API (https://github.com/LiveSplit/SpeedrunDotComAPI).
I followed [this tutorial](https://discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html) with the initial bot connection
